    "enDesc": "The Kuzari was written by Judah Halevi (Spain, 1075 – 1141). Originally written in Arabic, it describes how the king of the Khazars (an Asian tribe that converted to Judaism in the eighth century), in an attempt to determine which is the true religion, invites representatives of each of the three major religions to come and explain his beliefs. The group includes a Muslim imam, a Christian priest and a rabbi. The king is won over by the rabbi's arguments, and during the ensuing dialogue, the rabbi demonstrates the superiority of his faith by bringing clear proof to the biblical account of the giving of the Torah at Sinai, and explaining the commandments in rational terms. Instead of using complicated philosophical ideas, he bases his arguments on history, tradition, and common sense. In the introduction, the author states that the purpose of his work is to reply to the attacks of those who wish to denigrate Judaism.  The Kuzari is considered one of the most important works of Jewish apologetica and has been reprinted many times in several languages.",
