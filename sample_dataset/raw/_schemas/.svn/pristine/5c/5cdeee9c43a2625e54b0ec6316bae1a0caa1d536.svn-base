    "enDesc": "The Book of Hosea is the first of the Tere Asar (Twelve Minor Prophets). The term denotes the short length of the text in relation to the longer prophetic texts known as the Major Prophets. He prophesies during a dark and melancholic era of Israel's history, the period of the Northern Kingdom's decline and fall. The apostasy of the people was rampant, having turned away from God in order to serve the calves of Jeroboam and Baal, a Canaanite god. The prophecy of Hosea centres on God's unending love towards a sinful Israel. In this text, God's agony is expressed over the betrayal of Israel. Hosea was directed by God to marry a prostitute. Marriage here is symbolic of the covenantal relationship between God and Israel. However, Israel has been unfaithful to God by following other gods and breaking the commandments which are the terms of the covenant, hence Israel is symbolized by a harlot who violates the obligations of marriage to her husband.",
