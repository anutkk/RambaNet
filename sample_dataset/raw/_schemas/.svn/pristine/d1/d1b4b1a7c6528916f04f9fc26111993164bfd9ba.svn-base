    "enDesc": "The Book of Malachi is the twelfth of the Tere Asar (Twelve Minor Prophets). The term denotes the short length of the text in relation to the longer prophetic texts known as the Major Prophets. The book is commonly attributed to a prophet by the name of Malachi though one of the Targums identifies Ezra as the author of Malachi. The Book of Malachi was written to correct the lax religious and social behaviour of the Israelites – particularly the priests – in post-exilic Jerusalem. Although the prophets urged the people of Judah and Israel to see their exile as punishment for failing to uphold their covenant with God, it was not long after they had been restored to the land and to Temple worship that the people's commitment to their God began once again to wane.",
