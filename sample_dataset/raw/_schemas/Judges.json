    "enDesc": "The second of the four books making up the Neviim Rishonim (Early Prophets) - Shofetim (Judges) is divided into three major sections: a double prologue, a main body and a double epilogue. The book opens with the Israelites in the land of Canaan which God has promised to them, but worshiping foreign gods. The main body gives six accounts each concerning a major judge and their struggles against the oppressive kings of the surrounding nations. The main judges are Othniel, Ehud, Deborah and Barak, Gideon, Abimelch an Israelite who oppresses his own people, Jephthah and Samson. The minor judges are Shamgar, Tola, Jair, Ibzan, Elon and Abdon. The Epilogue concludes with stories that are not connected to a specific judge; Dan and the Idols of Micah and Gibeah and the Levite Concubine.",
