    "enDesc": "The Book of Micah is the sixth of the Tere Asar (Twelve Minor Prophets). The term denotes the short length of the text in relation to the longer prophetic texts known as the Major Prophets. It records the sayings of Micah, a prophet from the village of Moresheth in Judah. The book has three major divisions, chapters 1–2, 3–5 and 6–7, each introduced by the word \"Hear,\" with a pattern of alternating announcements of doom and expressions of hope within each division. Micah reproaches unjust leaders, defends the rights of the poor against the rich and powerful, and preaches social justice; while looking forward to a world at peace centred on Zion under the leadership of a new Davidic monarch. While the book is relatively short, it includes lament (1.8–16; 7.8–10), theophany (1.3–4), hymnic prayer of petition and confidence (7.14–20),[7] and the \"covenant lawsuit\" (6.1–8), a distinct genre in which God sues Israel for breach of contract, that is, for violation of the Sinai covenant.",
