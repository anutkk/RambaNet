    "enDesc": "Ezra–Nehemiah is the original combined version of the biblical books of Ezra and Nehemiah—the two were originally one, but were divided by Christians in the 3rd century CE and in Jewish circles in the 15th century. The text of Ezra–Nehemiah is composed largely in Late Biblical Hebrew with significant sections in Aramaic; there are occasional reflections of Old Persian vocabulary, but little significant influence from Greek. Covering the period from the fall of Babylon in 539 BCE to the second half of the 5th century BCE, it tells of the successive missions to Jerusalem of Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah, and their efforts to restore the worship of the God of Israel and to create a purified Jewish community. The narrative is highly schematic, each stage of the restoration following the same pattern: God \"stirs up\" the Persian king, the king commissions a Jewish leader to undertake a task, the leader overcomes opposition and succeeds, and success is marked by a great assembly.",
