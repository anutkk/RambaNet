    "enDesc": "The Shulhan Arukh HaRav (Code of Jewish Law by the Rabbi) is a record of prevailing halakha by Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi, known during his lifetime as HaRav (The Rabbi) of Habad. Within the Habad community the work is known as the Alter Rebbe's Shulhan Arukh. Although widely accepted, the work was originally limited in printings. Much of the original text was destroyed in a fire in Lubavitch, and only parts of copies of the draft survived. The Shulhan Arukh HaRav is today used by most Hasidim as their basis for daily practice. It is broadly considered an authoritative halakhic text, and is frequently cited by later authorities such as Yisrael Meir Kagan in his Mishnah Berurah and Hakham Yosef Haim in his the Ben Ish Hai of, as well as in many contemporary responsa by leading halachic authorities of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. It is also one of the three works on which Shlomo Ganzfried based his Kitzur Shulhan Arukh, the well-known precis of customary Ashkenazi Halakha.",
