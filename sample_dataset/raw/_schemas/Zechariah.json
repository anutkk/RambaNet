    "enDesc": "The Book of Zechariah is the eleventh of the Tere Asar (Twelve Minor Prophets). The term denotes the short length of the text in relation to the longer prophetic texts known as the Major Prophets. Zechariah’s ministry took place during the reign of Darius the Great (Zechariah 1:1), and was contemporary with Haggai in a post-exilic world after the fall of Jerusalem. Zechariah is specific about dating his writing 520–518 BCE. Chapters 1 to 6 recall the nation's history, for the purpose of presenting a solemn warning to the present generation. Chapters 7 and 8, delivered two years later, are an answer to the question whether the days of mourning for the destruction of the city should be kept any longer, and an encouraging address to the people, assuring them of God's presence and blessing. Chapters 9 to 14 consist of two “prophecies” or \"burdens\". The first prophecy (ch. 9-11) gives an outline of the course of God's providential dealings with his people down to the time of the coming of the Messiah. The second prophecy (ch. 12–14) points out the glories that await Israel in \"the latter day\", the final conflict and triumph of God's kingdom.",
